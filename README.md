# airbnb_hack
created a airbnb wesite that can authenticate the user and authorise the listing controls with user details.<br><br>
we can add new listings also fron clicking on "airbnb your home" on navbar, need to login or signup first, after adding new listing we can edit that and delete that also ( only who created that listing).<br> <br>
we can add reviews also but for adding review we need to login first, after uploading review we can only delete that review (only who created that review).<br><br>
added a 3d map inside full listing page and under the map i added a button to go to see the current weather data of that listing location and next 5 days of weather forcast also.
