# airbnb_hack
created a airbnb wesite that can authenticate the user and authorise the listing controls with user details.<br><br>
we can add new listings also, by clicking on 'airbnb your home' on navbar, need to login or signup first, after adding new listing, we can edit that and delete that also ( only who created that listing), other person who is not the owner of that listing will not able to see the delete and edit buttons those are visible to listing owner only.<br> <br>
we can add reviews also its in 'full listing page' but for adding review we need to login or signUp first, after uploading review we can delete that review also (only who created that review), review that is posted by other person we can not delete that.<br><br>
added a 3d map inside 'full listing page' and under the map i added a button to go to see the current weather data of that listing location and next 5 days of weather forcast data also.
